 wc_horde_invasion.medivh.1000.desc:0 "My entire body trembles as I utter the final syllables of the incantation. The storm roars with intensified fury, as if the heavens themselves refuse what I am about to do.\n\nBefore me, the stones shift with a terrifying rumble as the Dark Portal rises, immense and menacing. Its dark energy pulses through the air, and a magical vortex swirls around its frame. There is no turning back now...\nI raise my arms, invoking the forces of the Nether, and with a deafening crash, the Portal opens, releasing a chilling mist. I can feel them, on the other side: the Orcs.\n\nMy duty fulfilled, I use the last of my energy to recall myself to Karazhan. I light a fire and collapse before the flames, letting out a weary sigh. That wretched warlock... He will undoubtedly betray us, but he will have to wait before we deem him worthy of our attention. The fate of Azeroth is sealed, and what I have done today will usher in an era of chaos and unprecedented destruction upon our world."

 wc_horde_invasion.1001.desc:0 "It is time to stop this carnage. The Horde has conquered enough land to start a new life in Azeroth. Many orcs are returning to their families, burying their axes in the ground. They have vowed to forget the horrors of war that they had to go through. The warlords of the Horde still pose a threat to some parts of Azeroth, but the bloodiest wars are behind us since the clans no longer see the point in keeping the Horde united."

 wc_horde_invasion.orcish_shamanism.1005.desc:0 "The crackling flames of torches illuminate the faces of the warriors gathered here.

 wc_horde_invasion.other.1005.desc:0 "From afar, the glow of torches pierces the oppressive darkness of the swamp. As I approach quietly, driven by curiosity, I see hundreds of figures gathered around a tent. A powerful voice rises, deep and guttural.\n\nI cannot understand a single word of the speech, but every roar carries a raw, savage energy. When it ends, a thunderous cheer erupts, and the figures begin to move.\n\nThey are preparing for something."
 wc_horde_invasion.1005.a:0 "Lok'tar Ogar! Blood and thunder!"

Some among their council already tremble at the reports of our strength; they speak of crawling north, begging for aid. We cannot allow that to happen!\n\nWarriors of the [warchief.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTooltip], this cursed swamp is no place to forge our destiny. [king_of_stormwind.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] must fall, and we will leave behind nothing but ashes and despair to crush their pathetic kingdoms!""

 wc_horde_invasion.1502.desc:0 "For years now, [guldan.GetFirstName] has gathered the orcs at the [Glossary( 'Throne of Kil’Jaeden', 'THRONE_OF_KILJAEDEN_GLOSS' )], offering them his [Glossary( '"gift"', 'BLOOD_OF_MANNOROTH_GLOSS' )]. This brew strengthened us, but it also tainted our skin with a green hue and awakened a deep thirst for blood and violence. Horrified by what I witnessed, I forbade the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun] from touching it. Yet it wasn’t enough — our skin turned green as well, and already I can see the bloodlust creeping into our hearts.\n\nThe clans left behind on Draenor have fallen into savage madness. [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetFirstName] had chosen only those with a shred of reason left, like us, to follow him here, to Azeroth."
 wc_horde_invasion.1502.desc_normal_outro:0 "\n\n[orgrim.GetFirstName] still doubts me; he claims that a single orc cannot destroy an entire world.

 wc_horde_invasion.1502.a_alternative.flavor:0 "You take a deep breath, telling yourself that with Gul’dan gone, the corruption will fade in time. Yet a shadow of doubt lingers in your mind — you can still feel its grip on your people, no matter how hard you try to deny it."
 wc_horde_invasion.1502.b:0 "I have to follow the other clans for now."
 wc_horde_invasion.1502.b.flavor:0 "The taste of defeat is bitter on your tongue. The other clans have already chosen their path and refuse to listen — for now, you must follow, bowing to the will of the dae’mons. You need time — time to find the moment when you can save your people."

When I [Glossary( 'sacrificed my eye', 'EYE_RITUAL_GLOSS' )], I saw my own death: struck down by unknown enemies. Now I understand, they are the pink-skins of this world!\n\n[ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] respects me and grants me a measure of freedom.

 wc_horde_invasion.1505.title:0 "The Whispers"
 wc_horde_invasion.1505.desc:0 "The moment #EMP we#! crossed the Dark Portal, visions and whispers besieged #EMP our#! minds.

But over time, as I led [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName|l], I came to understand. These visions do not come from demons but from their forgotten gods, forces far older and more powerful than the Legion itself.\n\n#EMP Gall#! remains strangely silent. #EMP He#!, so prone to impulsiveness, seems untouched by these voices. But I hear them, growing ever stronger… And #EMP our#! [Glossary( 'pale orcs', 'PALE_ORCS_GLOSS' )] — once the most unruly of all the clans — now obey #EMP us#! without question, as if guided by a superior will.

 wc_horde_invasion.1506.desc:0 ""#EMP (KILL [devoted.GetHerHim]!)#!" growled Gall when I tore [devoted.GetNamePossessive] soul from [devoted.GetHerHis] body, sending it to [new_faith.PositiveAfterLife].\n\n"Do you see, Gall? Their essence completes the circle. [new_faith.PantheonTerm|U] approve of this offering. #EMP (Hah! POWER… YES!

[new_faith.PantheonTerm|U] have revealed the truth that will be inscribed within: the Titans, the Black Empire, the Legion, the Void...\n\nOver the past few weeks, Gall has opened himself to the whispers.

 wc_horde_invasion.9000.desc:0 "As the defenses of $c_northshire$ and its surrounding lands fall, our warriors descend into a frenzy of destruction. The breakthrough has unleashed an orgy of violence; every building is pillaged, every human cut down in their tracks.\n\nThe final stand of the humans is at the abbey. As our warriors surround it, we uproot an ancient tree from the gardens to use as a battering ram. Each thunderous crash against the abbey's doors mingles the roars of our war cries with the terrified screams of those inside. The timber groans, splinters flying, as the last barrier to our wrath buckles and bends.\n\nJust as the door begins to give way, poised to unleash our horde into their last haven, we prepare to extinguish the final flicker of resistance in $c_northshire$."
 wc_horde_invasion.9000.a:0 "Lok'tar Ogar, for the Horde!"
 wc_horde_invasion.9001.title:0 "The Last Stand of $c_northshire$"
 wc_horde_invasion.9001.desc:0 "The fall of $c_northshire$ is a nightmare come to life. The lands burn around us, and our people are mercilessly slaughtered. We last few defenders have retreated to the abbey, our final sanctuary.\n\nThrough the barricaded doors, we hear the orcs' fury grow louder. They have uprooted one of the sacred Holyoak trees from our gardens, transforming it into a tool of destruction. Each impact against the doors sends a wave of dread through our hearts. Our prayers for salvation are drowned out by the cacophony of battle - the orcs' battle cries, the splintering wood, the screams of the doomed.\n\nAs the doors begin to splinter and crack, the end nears. We brace ourselves, knowing that the flood of rage and steel is about to break through, and with it, the last light of $c_northshire$ will be extinguished."

 wc_horde_invasion.9002.desc:0 "Now that $c_northshire$ is under our control, bands of orcs spread through the surrounding lands, leaving behind smoking ruins. Homes are looted and burned, fields destroyed, and no inhabitant is spared from their bloodthirsty rage. Faced with this, I am confronted with a choice:\n\n On the one hand, I can let my warriors' thirst for violence run free. Northshire would be devastated, and its riches would fuel the machine of our conquests, a brutal testament to the futility of opposing the Horde.\nAlternatively, I could order my warriors to cease their destruction. Executing those who defy this order would be necessary to maintain discipline. This would allow for the preservation and repurposing of key structures for the use of the Horde, transforming the remains of $c_northshire$ into a strategic foothold for our future campaigns. The decision rests with me..."

 # Glossary
 #################################

 THRONE_OF_KILJAEDEN_GLOSS:0 "The Throne of Kil'Jaeden was once a sacred mountain of the Bonechewer Clan, located in the Hellfire Peninsula, formerly the Tanaan Jungle. Gul'dan renamed this site when he gathered all the orcish clans here for a dark ritual — drinking the blood of Mannoroth, sealing their pact with the Burning Legion, and forever altering the fate of the orcs."
 BLOOD_OF_MANNOROTH_GLOSS:0 "The Blood of Mannoroth, a vile substance, is the very essence of the pit lord Mannoroth. When consumed, it grants immense strength and bloodlust but at a terrible cost: eternal servitude to the Burning Legion. It was this cursed blood that Gul'dan used to corrupt the orcs, marking the beginning of their descent into darkness."
 JUNGLE_OF_TANAAN_GLOSS:0 "Once a lush and untamed jungle, Tanaan was home to some of the fiercest orc clans. But, as Draenor fell into decline, it withered at an alarming and unexplained pace. Today, it is nothing more than a barren wasteland, now known as the Hellfire Peninsula."
 EYE_RITUAL_GLOSS:0 "When a new chieftain rises, every Bleeding Hollow lord must undergo the dark Eye Ritual. This rite demands they sacrifice one of their eyes in exchange for a prophetic vision of their own death. It is no trivial act: those who dare to perform the ritual emerge forever changed, freed from fear but haunted by the certainty of their fate."
 CHOGALL_FORMATION_GLOSS:0 "The arrogance and thirst for power of Cho and Gall led to their exile from Highmaul, their birthplace. When Gul’dan created the Shadow Council, he took Cho’gall under his wing, teaching him the demonic arts. Thus, Cho’gall became one of the first ogre mages bound to the Horde and a devoted servant of the Shadow Council."
 PALE_ORCS_GLOSS:0 "The pale orcs, Void-corrupted outcasts beneath Nagrand, worshipped the Void and its prophecy of the Hour of Twilight — when darkness consumes the cosmos. Once savage and uncontrollable, they embraced Cho’gall as the herald of their dark gods when he came to annihilate them. He returned to the Horde with these fanatics fully under his control."
